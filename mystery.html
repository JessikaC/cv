    <h1>Mysteries and Murders</h1>
    <p>Here is another hobbie that helps me through the day. While I am getting ready, I listen to podcasts or YouTube videos about unsolved crimes or cases that were a challange to solve. Do you want to take a look on them?</p>
<hr>
    <h4>List of cases:</h4>
    <ul>

      <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disappearance_of_Susan_Powell" target="_blank">The Disappearance of Susan Powell</a>. Perhaps because this case hits close home (Utah), it is a case often in my noggin. Susan is a missing wife, with a troubled marriage and creepy father-in-law. She is missing for more than 11 years.</li>
